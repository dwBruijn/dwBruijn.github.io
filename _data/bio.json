      "I'm a Software Engineer with 3 years of experience specilizing in Backend development and Cloud engineering. I enjoy coding, especially when it involves collaborating with a team to tackle complex problems and coming up with scalable and cost-efficient solutions.",
      "My involvement in cybersecurity since high school (bug bounty hunting, malware analysis, and threat intelligence) helped me develop an attacker's mindset, which gives me a unique edge in system design and secure coding practices that most engineers simply don't have.",
      "While ChatGPT might be quicker at cranking out CRUD stacks, I believe my real value comes in balancing the trade-offs, working with people, and finding the right solutions that align with business requirements and budget constraints.",
      "I like to keep things light and fun, but I'm serious about delivering quality. Whether it's diving into code reviews or process improvements, I aim for a balance of high standards and practical solutions."
