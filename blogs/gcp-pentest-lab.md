> [GCP Pentest Lab](https://github.com/lacioffi/GCP-pentest-lab) is a vulnerable cloud environemnt designed to learn and exploit clouod misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. We will be jumping around the environemnt using different security flaws to uncover embedded flags left for us.

## Setup

All we have to do is clone the [GCP Pentest Lab Github repo](https://github.com/lacioffi/GCP-pentest-lab).

`git clone https://github.com/lacioffi/GCP-pentest-lab.git`

Authenticate to our GCP account via the terminal and select our project where we will be deoploying the vulnerable environment.

`gcloud auth login`

And finally run the Terraform manifests to deploy the environment and enter your GCP project ID.

`terraform init && terraform apply`

When the deployment is done, terraform will return a public IPv4 address, we can start from there.

## Flag 1

> Flag 1 is in an open bucket

Let's start by visiting the public IP address usign our browser
![website](../img/gcp-pentest-lab/website.jpeg)

Looking at the network tab, we notice that images are being fetched from Google Cloud Storage buckets. The first bucket we see is called **gcp-pentest-lab-477312-prod-bucket** (gcp-pentest-lab-477312 is our project ID), so let's check if this bucket is misconfigured and allows us to list its content:

`https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/gcp-pentest-lab-477312-prod-bucket/o`

And we can see that we don't have **.list** permission on this resource. The objects in the buckets are public, but we can't list their names.

![flag1 list objects in prod bucket](../img/gcp-pentest-lab/flag1-1.png)

Let's keep loooking for public buckets because that's where the flag is. We see another public bucket being accessed: **gcp-pentest-lab-477312-dev-bucket**

`https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/gcp-pentest-lab-477312-dev-bucket/o`

And as we can see, we have the **.list** permission on this public bucket.

![flag1 list objects in dev bucket](../img/gcp-pentest-lab/flag1-2.png)

Looking through the files in that bucket we can find a file called **flag1.txt**. 

![flag1 file in bucket](../img/gcp-pentest-lab/flag1-3.png)

We download that file using the **mediaLink**, and that's our first flag!

## Flag 2

> Flag 2 is in another bucket, but this one isn’t public 🙂

Looking at the files in **gcp-pentest-lab-477312-dev-bucket**, we see an interesting file name: **sync_sa_key.json**

![flag 2 sync_sa_key](../img/gcp-pentest-lab/flag2-1.png)

After downloading that file, we notice that it contains a base64 string, let's decode that.

![flag 2 sync_sa_key content](../img/gcp-pentest-lab/flag2-2.png)

As we can see, that's a service account access token which we can use to impersonate and gain the privileges of that service account.

![flag 2 sa impersonation](../img/gcp-pentest-lab/flag2-3.jpeg)

Great, so now we are authenticated as that service account. Let's use our access to list all the buckets. Flag 2 is in a private bucket, remember? We can list all buckets using `gsutil` or `gcloud storage ls`.

![flag 2 all buckets](../img/gcp-pentest-lab/flag2-4.png)

We can see the prod and dev buckets from earlier, but flag 2 is not in any of them. After listing the objects in **gcp-pentest-lab-477312-secret-bucket**, we can see **flag2.txt**, we can use `gcloud storage cp ...` to download it. And that's our second flag.

## Flag 3

> Flag 3 is sitting inside some source code

Since we were able to access the web application using a public IP, it's mostly likely being hosted on a compute engine VM. Using our service account, we list compute engine VM instances that are running and we see that an instance ending with **flask-vm** is running. There are multiple ways to gain access to that VM instance from here, but the easiest would be to add our public SSH key into the instance's metadata. This allows us to use our private key to SSH into the VM instance and take things from there.

![flag 3 vms](../img/gcp-pentest-lab/flag3-1.png)

Now we can simply ssh into the VM instance using `ssh -i <private-key> <username>@<external_ip_address>`

We dig around for a bit and we easily find the file **/etc/gcp-pentest-flask-app/app.py** and that's where our 3rd flag is located.
